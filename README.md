While we are falling in love with the code, we are firstly a human who will get married! 
While we find a lover, hug and kiss, and go to the stage of married, new problem comes -- a ring. 
While 'A diamond is forever', in fact, is a trick for centuries, anyone who wants to get married have to compromise.

We find for help on the Internet, but get something copied, outtime and unuseful.
So, Let's fuck gemstone in the knowledge's ocean!
